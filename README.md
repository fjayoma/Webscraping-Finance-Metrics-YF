# Webscraping-Finance-Metrics-YF
This is my first webscraping project where I pull finance metrics from Yahoo Finance using the Requests and Beautiful Soup Libraries.

Update 12.4.21

I've updated this project to include functions, so that a user can enter an infinite amount of Ticker Symbols and search for various finance metrics on Yahoo Finance.
